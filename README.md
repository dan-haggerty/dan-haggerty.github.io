## Welcome to my page!

Here is a piece of advice. If you are trying to create a User Github Page, make sure you select the option to add a README file when you create the repository.
If you don't, the automatic set up won't work and you'll end up creating a Project Page instead. Project pages don't automatically appear at [username].github.io. They appear at [username].github.io/[name of repository]. 
That only too me an hour to figure out.
